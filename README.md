# Useful-for-DS5110
Welcome! Found in this repository is a compilation of sources, website links, tutorials, and personal notes that I found useful for those taking *DS5110: Essentials of Data Science*--a data science course at Northeastern University. The cheat sheets, links, and tutorials are sources I found online, while any "useful notes" are self-made.
